# Report-Deck

People can use it for launching complaints which are usually ignored due to the means used.
Official email id's through which we can reach out is not efficient at all.
Our app aims in solving this issue by connecting students to the concerned authorities who can help them with their problems.
"Does any such thing even exist for our university??" is the general question asked,we want to address and fill this gap through the power of our app.
Our app is user friendly and also has options for ananomity without risking authenticity.
We pool all the data collected on problem solving and share them to different universities if their students are also facing the same problems.
One can help the other, this is our main motive.
We will try and connect as many institutions as we can, so that the inputs which we get also increase and hence the productivity of the app will also increase.
As we will be continuously monitoring the data, if the institution is ignoring the problems, then we can send them notification/alerts that the problem is getting our of hand and needs immediate attention.
We also have the option to make our complains either public or private .
We can stop malpractice by 3 strike policy.
We will have proper signed terms and conditions where if any representative body has to access a student's personal information for any sensitive case, it will be just in between the representative body and the student.
No council member or other student has access to the details of the students for any anonimous mails.
We have broad categorization for different types of problems.
